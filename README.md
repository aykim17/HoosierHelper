# HoosierHelper
Bookmarklet for quick-viewing course grade distributions at IU.
For Hoosiers who are scheduling their coursework, it can be a real pain to find grade distributions for specific courses- there's no search feature.  This program makes it easy to find the most recent grade distributions for a given course.

## Instructions for Installation
1. Click the HoosierHelper.txt file.
2. Drag the contents into your browser's bookmarks bar.
3. Give the Bookmarklet a name (just as you would any other bookmark).
4. To run, simply click the Bookmarklet, enter the course name as instructed, then hit enter. This will open a new tab featuring the most recent grade distributions for the entered course.

* Note: this program currently displays the grade distributions for <b>Spring 2017</b>.  I'll update the program as more recent grade distributions become available. *
